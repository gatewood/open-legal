==========

Legal documents or pieces of legal documents for reference.

These are forms that I have used, or that I am working on, for general reference or for specific uses.

Unless I am already your lawyer, use of these forms do not make me your lawyer.  These will not fit every situation, and some of them will not fit many situations at all.

Feel free to contribute and use these reference pieces as you see fit.

Cheers,

Chris
